# PLAXISPlayground  

**PLAXISPlayground** is a collection of Python tools designed to work with PLAXIS software, enabling advanced data analysis and visualization for geotechnical engineering. These tools allow you to:  

- Extract and process stress point data from PLAXIS.  
- Create animations of stress trajectories.  
- Evaluate yield surface variations.  
- Analyze soil behavior models such as PM4Sand, PM4Silt, Hardening Soil (HS), Mohr-Coulomb (MC), and more.  

## What is PLAXIS?  

[PLAXIS](https://www.plaxis.com) is a leading geotechnical engineering software for numerical analysis. It is widely used to model soil behavior and simulate soil-structure interactions using the Finite Element Method (FEM).  

If you don’t already have PLAXIS, you can learn more and purchase a license at the official website:

## Features of PLAXISPlayground  

- **Automation**: Simplify repetitive tasks by connecting with PLAXIS to extract data.  
- **Visualization**: Generate high-quality plots and animations for improved geotechnical data interpretation.  
- **Compatibility**: Supports multiple constitutive models implemented in PLAXIS.  

## How to Use  

Examples and detailed usage instructions will be provided soon.
