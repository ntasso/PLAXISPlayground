# PLAXISPlayground  

**PLAXISPlayground** is a collection of Python tools designed to work with PLAXIS software, enabling advanced data analysis and visualization for geotechnical engineering. These tools allow you to:  

- Extract and process stress point data from PLAXIS.  
- Create animations of stress trajectories.  
- Evaluate yield surface variations.  
- Analyze soil behavior models such as PM4Sand, PM4Silt, Hardening Soil (HS), Mohr-Coulomb (MC), and more.  

## What is PLAXIS?  

[PLAXIS](https://www.plaxis.com) is a leading geotechnical engineering software for numerical analysis. It is widely used to model soil behavior and simulate soil-structure interactions using the Finite Element Method (FEM).  

If you donâ€™t already have PLAXIS, you can learn more and purchase a license at the official website:  
[https://www.plaxis.com](https://www.plaxis.com)  

## Features of PLAXISPlayground  

- **Automation**: Simplify repetitive tasks by connecting with PLAXIS to extract data.  
- **Visualization**: Generate high-quality plots and animations for improved geotechnical data interpretation.  
- **Compatibility**: Supports multiple constitutive models implemented in PLAXIS.  

## Requirements  

1. **PLAXIS**: An active PLAXIS license is required to use these tools.  
2. **Python**: Version 3.7 or higher.  
3. **Python Libraries**: See `requirements.txt` for a list of necessary dependencies.  

## Installation
